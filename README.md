# LAPD-Crime-Data

## **Describing Our Dataset and What Data it Contains:**

The dataset weâ€™re using represents crime statistics in Los Angeles as reported by the LAPD, with dates ranging from the year 2020 to 2024. Within the dataset are variables such as the type of crime committed, the year the crime was committed, the sex of the victim, the type of weapon used, and more. This dataset was created by the request of the FBI and is utilized by them today.

## **The Two Questions Our Team Generated and Why They Are Interesting and Important:**

**Question 1: How do monthly crime patterns for assault, battery, burglary, vandalism, and stolen vehicles differ by month/season, and are there consistent seasonal peaks?**  

Revealing seasonal crime trends helps law enforcement plan ahead, allocate resources, and raise public awareness during high-risk months.


**Question 2: To what proportion are men and women victims of crimes involving different weapons?**  

Helps identify gender-based vulnerability to weapon-related crimes and supports more targeted safety policies and victim support programs.  

## **The Manipulations Applied to The Data Set as Part of the Analysis:**  

**Question 1:**  
- Year (2020-2023 to disclude possible bias)
- Crime description (5 crimes with most volatility)
  
**Question 2:**  
- Victim sex (male, female)
- Weapon Description (discludes "null")
- Crime count (count < 6k)
