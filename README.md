## **Why This Question is Interesting and Important:**  
Helps identify gender-based vulnerability to weapon-related crimes and supports more targeted safety policies and victim support programs.

## **The Manipulations Applied to The Data Set as Part of the Analysis:**   
- Victim sex (male, female)
- Weapon Description (discludes "null")
- Crime count (visualization 1: count < 10k) (visualization 2: count > 10k)

## **Analysis and Results:** 
The data indicates that men have a higher likelihood of being victims of these violent crimes than women.  
Data points that stand out in the set:  
- The dataset separates handgun crimes from pistol crimes. For some reason, handgun crimes only include female victims (zero records of male victims). However, men are included as victims of pistol crimes, where they make up the majority.
